# Overview

RethinkDB is the first open-source, scalable JSON database built from
the ground up for the realtime web. This charm installs and
configures [RethinkDB](https://www.rethinkdb.com/).

# Usage

Deploy the RethinkDB charm with the following:

```bash
juju deploy cs:~tengu-team/rethinkdb-0
```
The RethinkDB UI is then available at `http://x.x.x.x:8080`.

# Limitations
- At this moment RethinkDB can only run in stand-alone mode.
